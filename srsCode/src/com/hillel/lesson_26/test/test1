1. Create a function (findSeven) that takes an array of numbers and return "Found"

if the character 7 appears in the array of the numbers. Otherwise, return "there is no 7 in the array".

Examples :
findSeven([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]) ➞ "Found"
// 7 contains the number seven.
findSeven([8, 6, 33, 100]) ➞ "there is no 7 in the array"
// None of the items contain 7 within them.
findSeven([2, 55, 60, 97, 86]) ➞ "Found"
// 97 contains the number seven.

2.Create a function (digitSum) that accepts an integer and calculates the sum of it's digits.
If the sum is greater than 9 repeats the calculation of the sum of it's digits until we get sum < 10.
Returns the final sum.

examples
10 -> 1 + 0 = 1 ... returns 1
38 -> 3 + 8 = 11 -> 1 + 1 = 2 ... returns 2
785 -> 7 + 9 + 5 = 21 -> 2 + 1 = 3  returns 3
99892 -> 9 + 9 + 8 + 9 + 2 = 37 -> 3 + 7 = 10 -> 1 + 0 = 1 returns 1

3.Create a function (doRemake) that takes a string of words and

-Move the first letter of each word to the end of the word.
-Add "ay" to the end of the word.
-Words starting with a vowel (a,e,i,o,u, A, E, I, O, U) simply have "way" appended to the end.
-Be sure to preserve proper capitalization and punctuation.

Examples:
doRemake("Cats are great pets.")
returns "Atscay areway reatgay etspay."

doRemake("Tom got a small piece of pie.")
returns "Omtay otgay away allsmay iecepay ofway iepay."

doRemake("He told us a very exciting tale.")
returns "Ehay oldtay usway away eryvay excitingway aletay."
